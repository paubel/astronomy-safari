                    <p class="start-text">A galaxy is a collection of stars, stellar remains, interstellar gas, dust,
                        and dark matter that are gravitationally bonded together. A galaxy range in size from dwarf
                        galaxies with
                        fewer than 100 million stars to supergiants, which have 100 trillion stars around their galaxy's
                        center of mass. It's believed that the centers of several of them contain supermassive black
                        holes. The majority of galaxies are between 3,000 and 300,000 light years apart and are spaced
                        at intervals of millions of light years. </p>
                    <p>Galaxies can be classed as spiral, elliptical, or irregular based on certain characteristics.
                        They can also be further split based on the predominant morphology of their visible stars. These
                        various geometries are believed to be the result of various rates and types of star formation,
                        as well as later dynamical influences from dark matter distributions.</p>
                    <p>Galaxies are made up of many different elements, such as stars, gas, and dust, as well as an
                        opacity that is typically attributed to dark matter. Particular importance is attached to a

                    <p class="start-text">A form of galaxy known as an elliptical galaxy has a smooth, nearly
                        featureless appearance and an approximate ellipsoidal shape. The majority of elliptical galaxies
                        are made up of older, low-mass stars, have a scant interstellar medium, little star formation,
                        and are frequently ringed by numerous globular clusters. Elliptical galaxies range in size from
                        dwarf ellipticals with tens of millions of stars to supergiants with more than one hundred
                        trillion stars that are the dominant members of their galaxy clusters..</p>

                    <p class="start-text">It is challenging to determine the sort of galaxy distant galaxies are due to
                        their tremendous distance. It has also taken time for the light to reach us so the observed
                        galaxy was
                        probably very early in its development. Another aspect is that we have so little data to go
                        on
                        with that other than say it is some kind of early galaxy we can’t be sure what type it is.

                    <p class="start-text">A dwarf galaxy is a relatively tiny galaxy with between 1000 and several
                        billion stars. Some people believe the Large Magellanic Cloud, which closely orbits the Milky
                        Way and has about 30 billion stars, to be a dwarf galaxy, while others see it as a full-fledged
                        galaxy. It is believed that interactions with larger galaxies have a significant impact on the
                        development and activity of dwarf galaxies. Based on their structure and makeup, astronomers
                        classify dwarf galaxies into a variety of categories.</p>

                        known as colliding or interacting galaxies. A satellite galaxy disrupting the spiral arms of the
                        main galaxy is an illustration of a minor interaction. A galactic collision, which could result
                        in a galaxy merger, is an example of a massive collision. During galactic evolution, galaxies
                        frequently collide. These are gravitational interactions rather than collisions in the
                        conventional sense due to the exceedingly tenuous distribution of matter in galaxies.

                    <p class="start-text">In contrast to spiral or elliptical galaxies, irregular galaxies lack a
                        recognizable regular shape. In addition to not fitting into any of the normal classes, irregular
                        galaxies frequently have a chaotic appearance and lack either a nuclear bulge or any indication
                        of spiral arm structure. They are estimated to make up around 25% of all galaxies in total. Some
                        asymmetric galaxies that are now irregular were formerly spiral or elliptical galaxies that were
                        distorted by an unequal external gravitational influence. 
                        Typically, irregular galaxies are tiny, with a mass of only a tenth that of the Milky Way
                        galaxy. They are vulnerable to environmental influences like colliding with massive galaxies and
                        cosmic radiation because of their small sizes.</p>

                    <p class="start-text">A form of galaxy that lies somewhere between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy
                        is called a lenticular galaxy. It lacks large-scale spiral arms but has a large-scale disc.
                        Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies with very little continuing star formation because they
                        have mostly used up or lost all of their interstellar materials. However, they might keep a lot
                        of dust in their disks. They are primarily made up of elderly stars as a result (like elliptical
                        galaxies). Lenticular and elliptical galaxies share characteristics including spectral features
                        and scale relations despite their physical variances. Both types of galaxies, at least in the
                        region where they are located, can be regarded as early-type galaxies that are passively
                        evolving.</p>

                    <p class="start-text">A supermassive black hole with a mass between millions and tens of billions of
                        solar masses that is fueled by a superluminous active galactic nucleus (AGN) and encircled by a
                        gaseous accretion disc is known as a quasar, also known as a quasi-stellar object. Due to
                        friction, the gas in the disc that is falling towards the black hole heats up and emits
                        electromagnetic radiation as a result. The most potent quasars have luminosities hundreds of
                        times larger than that of a galaxy like the Milky Way, demonstrating the immense radiant energy
                        of quasars. Typically, quasars are classified as a subclass of the AGN category, which is more
                        broadly defined. </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p class="start-text">A galaxy that resembles a circle is known as a ring galaxy. Numerous big,
                        relatively young blue stars that are exceptionally brilliant can be found in the ring. There
                        isn't a lot of bright substance in the center. Some astronomers think that smaller galaxies pass
                        through the center of larger galaxies to create ring galaxies. This "collision" hardly ever
                        causes any actual star collisions because the majority of a galaxy is empty space. However, due
                        to the gravitational perturbations brought on by such an occurrence, the larger galaxy can
                        experience a wave of star creation. Other astronomers believe that when external accretion
                        occurs, rings are created around some galaxies. The shocks and compressions of the accreted
                        material would then induce star formation.</p>

                    <p class="start-text">Along with quasars, Seyfert galaxies make up one of the two major groupings of
                        active galaxies. They contain quasar-like nuclei (very bright, far-off sources of
                        electromagnetic radiation) with very high surface brightnesses, and their spectra show strong,
                        high-ionization emission lines. However, unlike quasars, their host galaxies are easily
                        discernible.</p>
                    <p>
                        Seyfert galaxies, which make up 10% of all galaxies but are closer and less brilliant than
                        quasars, are among the most closely researched objects in astronomy because they are assumed to
                        be driven by the same processes as quasars. These galaxies include supermassive black holes at
                        their centers that are encircled by accretion discs of material falling into the galaxy. The UV
                        radiation seen is thought to have originated from the accretion discs. The greatest indicators
                        for the makeup of the surrounding material are ultraviolet emission and absorption lines.</p>
                    <p>
                        Most Seyfert galaxies appear to be regular spiral galaxies when viewed in visible light, but
                        when examined at other wavelengths, it is evident that their core luminosities are on par with
                        that of entire galaxies the size of the Milky Way.

                        Carl Seyfert, who initially identified this class in 1943, is honored by the term Seyfert
                        galaxies.</p>

                        of several hundred to thousands of galaxies that are gravitationally connected together. These
                        galaxies typically have masses between 10<sup>14</sup> and 10<sup>15</sup> solar masses. The
                        intracluster
                        medium is a crucial component of clusters (ICM). The ICM is made up of hot gas between the
                        galaxies that is influenced by the cluster's overall mass. Galaxy clusters should not be
                        confused with globular clusters, which commonly circle galaxies, or with galactic clusters, also
                        known as open clusters, which are star clusters within galaxies. Galaxy groups, as opposed to
                        galaxy clusters, are used to describe small collections of galaxies. Superclusters can form when
                        galaxy groupings and clusters combine together.

                        The Virgo Cluster, Fornax Cluster, Hercules Cluster, and Coma Cluster are notable galaxy
                        clusters in the very nearby Universe. Gigantic enough to have an impact on the local expansion

                        a few kilograms. Earth's air has a density of approximately 10<sup>10</sup> molecules per cubic
                        centimeter; The densest nebulae, in contrast, can contain 10,000 molecules per cubic centimeter.
                        While some nebulae are so diffused that they may only be seen with long exposures and
                        specialized filters, others are visible owing to fluorescence created by embedded blazing stars.

                    <p class="start-text">A dark nebula, also known as an absorption nebula, is a form of interstellar
                        cloud, particularly a molecular cloud, that is so dense that it absorbs all of the light from
                        objects behind it, including emission or reflection nebulae and background stars, at visible
                        wavelengths. Interstellar dust grains found in the coldest, densest areas of molecular clouds
                        are what are responsible for the light's extinction. Large complexes and clusters of dark
                        nebulae are connected to giant molecular clouds. Bok globules are tiny, isolated dark nebulae.
                        It obscures objects that are only visible in radio astronomy or infrared astronomy using radio
                        waves or other interstellar dust or debris.</p>

                    <p class="start-text">A nebula made of ionized gases that produce light at different wavelengths is
                        known as an emission nebula. High-energy ultraviolet photons emitted from a nearby bright star
                        are the primary cause of ionization. There are many different kinds of emission nebulae,
                        including H II regions, where star formation is occurring and young, massive stars are the
                        source of the ionizing photons, and planetary nebulae, where a dying star has shed its outer
                        layers, exposing the hot core, which then ionizes the surrounding gas. </p>

                    <p class="start-text">A planetary nebula is a particular kind of emission nebula made up of an
                        expanding, blazing disk of ionized gas that red giant stars late in their lives expel.

                        They have nothing to do with planets, therefore calling them "planetary nebula" is a misnomer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="start-text">
                        All planetary nebulae are created upon the death of intermediate-mass stars, which range in mass
                        from 1 to 8 solar masses. At the conclusion of its life cycle, it is anticipated that the Sun
                        will create a planetary nebula. Comparatively speaking to the somewhat longer phases of star
                        evolution, these occurrences are quite brief, lasting perhaps a few tens of millennia. After the
                        red giant's entire atmosphere has gone, the ejected material is ionized by strong ultraviolet
                        radiation from the exposed hot luminous core, also known as a planetary nebula nucleus. The
                        central star's nebulous gas shell is then energized by absorbed ultraviolet light, giving rise
                        to a vividly colored planetary nebula.</p>


                    <h3>Reflection nebulae</h3>
                    <figure> <img

                    <p class="start-text">Reflexion nebula are interstellar dust clouds in astronomy that may reflect
                        the light of one or more nearby stars. Although the energy from the neighboring stars is
                        insufficient to ionize the nebula's gas and produce an emission nebula, it is sufficient to
                        scatter light in such a way that the dust becomes visible. As a result, the frequency spectrum
                        displayed by reflection nebulae resembles that of the stars that illuminate the universe.
                        Diamond dust, for example, and compounds of other metals like iron and nickel are two examples
                        of the minuscule particles that cause the scattering. The latter two frequently line up with the
                        galactic magnetic field, which results in a little polarization of the scattered light.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p class="start-text">Stars, stellar remnants, and a diffuse interstellar medium of gas and dust are
                        all present in spiral galaxies like our own Milky Way. The interstellar medium normally contains
                        around 70% hydrogen by mass, with helium making up the majority of the remaining gas. Trace
                        amounts of heavier elements created and ejected from stars through the fusion of helium as they
                        proceeded beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime have chemically enriched this medium.
                        Star creation occurs in clouds, or diffuse nebulae, which are formed in the interstellar
                        medium's higher density areas. Unlike spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies lose their
                        interstellar medium's cold component in about a billion years, making it difficult for them to
                        generate diffuse nebulae unless they merge with other galaxies.</p>
                    <p class="start-text">

                        Since a large portion of the hydrogen in dense nebulae where stars are formed is in the
                        molecular (H2) form, these nebulae are known as molecular clouds. The Orion Nebula, around 1,300
                        light-years from the Sun, is the closest nebula where huge stars are forming.
                        However, in the Ophiuchi cloud complex, 400–450 light years away, lower mass star formation is
                        taking place. </p>

                    <p class="start-text">The structure left over from a supernova explosion is known as a supernova
                        remnant (SNR). The supernova remnant, which is surrounded by an expanding shock wave, is made up
                        of the ejected material from the explosion that is expanding as well as the interstellar debris
                        it sweeps up and shocks along the way.

                        There are two common ways for a star to go supernova: either it runs out of fuel and stops
                        producing fusion energy in its core, collapsing inward under the weight of its own gravity to
                        form a neutron star or a black hole; or it may accrete material from a companion star until it
                        reaches a critical mass and erupts in a thermonuclear explosion.

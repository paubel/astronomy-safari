                    <p class="start-text">A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust,
                        dark
                        matter, bound together by gravity. Range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred
                        million
                        stars, to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each
                        orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their
                        centers. Most galaxies are 3,000 to 300,000 light years and are separated by distances on the
                        order of millions of light years. </p>

                    <p class="start-text">An elliptical galaxy is a type of galaxy with an approximately ellipsoidal
                        shape and a smooth, nearly featureless image. Most elliptical galaxies are composed of older,
                        low-mass stars, with a sparse interstellar medium and minimal star formation activity, and they
                        tend to be surrounded by large numbers of globular clusters. Elliptical galaxies range in size
                        from dwarf ellipticals with tens of millions of stars, to supergiants of over one hundred
                        trillion stars that dominate their galaxy clusters.</p>

                    <p class="start-text">A dwarf galaxy is a small galaxy composed of about 1000 up to several billion
                        stars. The Large Magellanic Cloud, which closely orbits the Milky Way and contains over 30
                        billion stars, is sometimes classified as a dwarf galaxy; others consider it a full-fledged
                        galaxy. Dwarf galaxies' formation and activity are thought to be heavily influenced by
                        interactions with larger galaxies. Astronomers identify numerous types of dwarf galaxies, based
                        on their shape and composition.</p>

                    <p class="start-text">Interacting galaxies (colliding galaxies) are galaxies whose gravitational
                        fields result in a disturbance of one another. An example of a minor interaction is a satellite
                        galaxy disturbing the primary galaxy's spiral arms. An example of a major interaction is a
                        galactic collision, which may lead to a galaxy merger. Colliding galaxies are common during
                        galaxy evolution.The extremely tenuous distribution of matter in galaxies means these are not
                        collisions in the traditional sense of the word, but rather gravitational interactions.

                    <p class="start-text">An irregular galaxy is a galaxy that does not have a distinct regular shape,
                        unlike a spiral or an elliptical galaxy. Irregular galaxies do not fall into any of the regular
                        classes, and they are often chaotic in appearance, with neither a nuclear
                        bulge nor any trace of spiral arm structure. Collectively they are thought to make up about a
                        quarter of all galaxies. Some irregular galaxies were once spiral or elliptical galaxies but
                        were deformed by an uneven external gravitational force. Irregular galaxies may contain abundant
                        amounts of gas and dust.
                        Irregular galaxies are commonly small, about one tenth the mass of the Milky Way galaxy. Due to
                        their small sizes, they are prone to environmental effects like crashing with large galaxies and
                        intergalactic clouds.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p class="start-text">A lenticular galaxy is a type of galaxy intermediate between an
                        elliptical and a spiral galaxy. It
                        contains a large-scale disc but does not have large-scale spiral arms. Lenticular galaxies are
                        disc galaxies that have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have
                        very little ongoing star formation. They may, however, retain significant dust in their
                        disks. As a result, they consist mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies). Despite the
                        morphological differences, lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like
                        spectral features and scaling relations. Both can be considered early-type galaxies that are
                        passively evolving, at least in the local part of the Universe.</p>

                    <p class="start-text">A quasar, also known as a quasi-stellar object,
                        is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), powered by a
                        supermassive black hole, with mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of solar masses,
                        surrounded by a gaseous accretion disc. Gas in the disc falling towards the black hole heats up
                        because of friction and releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The radiant
                        energy of quasars is enormous; the most powerful quasars have luminosities thousands of times
                        greater than that of a galaxy such as the Milky Way. Usually, quasars are categorized as a
                        subclass of the more general category of AGN. </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p class="start-text">A ring galaxy is a galaxy with a circle-like appearance. The ring contains
                        many
                        massive, relatively young blue stars, which are extremely bright. The central region contains
                        relatively little luminous matter. Some astronomers believe that ring galaxies are formed when a
                        smaller galaxy passes through the center of a larger galaxy. Because most of a galaxy consists
                        of empty space, this "collision" rarely results in any actual collisions between stars. However,
                        the gravitational disruptions caused by such an event could cause a wave of star formation to
                        move through the larger galaxy. Other astronomers think that rings are formed around some
                        galaxies when external accretion takes place. Star formation would then take place in the
                        accreted material because of the shocks and compressions of the accreted material.</p>

                    <p class="start-text">Seyfert galaxies are one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, along
                        with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant and bright sources of
                        electromagnetic radiation) with very high surface brightnesses whose spectra reveal strong,
                        high-ionisation emission lines, but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly
                        detectable.</p>
                    <p>
                        Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies and are some of the most intensely
                        studied objects in astronomy, as they are thought to be powered by the same phenomena that occur
                        in quasars, although they are closer and less luminous than quasars. These galaxies have
                        supermassive black holes at their centers which are surrounded by accretion discs of in-falling
                        material. The accretion discs are believed to be the source of the observed ultraviolet
                        radiation. Ultraviolet emission and absorption lines provide the best diagnostics for the
                        composition of the surrounding material.</p>
                    <p>
                        Seen in visible light, most Seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies, but when studied
                        under other wavelengths, it becomes clear that the luminosity of their cores is of comparable
                        intensity to the luminosity of whole galaxies the size of the Milky Way.

                        Seyfert galaxies are named after Carl Seyfert, who first described this class in 1943.</p>

                    <p class="start-text">A galaxy cluster, or a cluster of galaxies, is a structure that consists of
                        anywhere from hundreds to thousands of galaxies that are bound together by gravity, with
                        typical masses ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 10<sup>15</sup> solar masses. One of the key
                        features of clusters is the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM
                        consists of heated gas between the galaxies that is
                        dependent on the total mass of the cluster. Galaxy clusters should not be confused with galactic
                        clusters (also known as open clusters), which are star clusters within galaxies, or with
                        globular clusters, which typically orbit galaxies. Small aggregates of galaxies are referred to
                        as galaxy groups rather than clusters of galaxies. The galaxy groups and clusters can themselves
                        cluster together to form superclusters.

                        Notable galaxy clusters in the relatively nearby Universe include the Virgo Cluster, Fornax
                        Cluster, Hercules Cluster, and the Coma Cluster. A very large aggregation of galaxies known as
                        the Great Attractor, dominated by the Norma Cluster, is massive enough to affect the local
                        expansion of the Universe.</p>

                        in the "Pillars of Creation" in the Eagle Nebula. In these regions, the formations of gas,
                        dust, and other materials "clump" together to form denser regions, which attract further

                        extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains located in the coldest, densest
                        parts of molecular clouds. Clusters and large complexes of dark nebulae are associated with
                        Giant Molecular Clouds. Isolated small dark nebulae are called Bok globules. Like other
                        interstellar dust or material, things it obscures are only visible using radio waves in radio
                        astronomy or infrared in infrared astronomy.</p>

                    <p class="start-text">An emission nebula is a nebula formed of ionized gases that emit light of
                        various
                        wavelengths. The most common source of ionization is high-energy ultraviolet photons emitted
                        from a nearby hot star. Among the several different types of emission nebulae are H II
                        regions, in which star formation is taking place and young, massive stars are the source of
                        the ionizing photons; and planetary nebulae, in which a dying star has thrown off its outer
                        layers, with the exposed hot core then ionizing them. </p>

                    <p class="start-text">A planetary nebula is a type of emission nebula consisting of
                        an
                        expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from red giant stars late in their lives.

                        The term "planetary nebula" is a misnomer because they are unrelated to planets.</p>
                    <p class="start-text">
                        All planetary nebulae form at the end of the life of a star of intermediate mass, about 1-8
                        solar masses. It is expected that the Sun will form a planetary nebula at the end of its
                        life cycle. They are relatively short-lived phenomena, lasting perhaps a few tens of
                        millennia, compared to considerably longer phases of stellar evolution. Once all of the
                        red giant's atmosphere has been dissipated, energetic ultraviolet radiation from the exposed
                        hot luminous core, called a planetary nebula nucleus, ionizes the ejected
                        material. Absorbed ultraviolet light then energizes the shell of nebulous gas around the
                        central star, causing it to appear as a brightly coloured planetary nebula.</p>


                    <h3>Reflection nebulae</h3>
                    <figure> <img

                    </figure>
                    <p class="start-text">In astronomy, reflection nebula are clouds of interstellar dust which might
                        reflect the light of a nearby star or stars. The energy from the nearby stars is insufficient to
                        ionize the gas of the nebula to create an emission nebula, but is enough to give sufficient
                        scattering to make the dust visible. Thus, the frequency spectrum shown by reflection nebulae is
                        similar to that of the illuminating stars. Among the microscopic particles responsible for the
                        scattering are carbon compounds (e. g. diamond dust) and compounds of other elements such as
                        iron and nickel. The latter two are often aligned with the galactic magnetic field and cause the
                        scattered light to be slightly polarized.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p class="start-text">A spiral galaxy like the Milky Way contains stars, stellar remnants, and a
                        diffuse
                        interstellar medium of gas and dust. The interstellar medium typically composed of roughly 70%
                        hydrogen by mass, with most of
                        the remaining gas consisting of helium. This medium has been chemically enriched by trace
                        amounts of heavier elements that were produced and ejected from stars via the fusion of
                        helium as they passed beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime. Higher density regions
                        of the interstellar medium form clouds, or diffuse nebulae, where star formation takes
                        place. In contrast to spirals, an elliptical galaxy loses the cold component of its
                        interstellar medium within roughly a billion years, which hinders the galaxy from forming
                        diffuse nebulae except through mergers with other galaxies.</p>
                    <p class="start-text">

                        In the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in the molecular (H2)
                        form, so these nebulae are called molecular clouds. The nearest nebula to the Sun
                        where massive stars are being formed is the Orion Nebula, 1,300 ly away.
                        However, lower mass star formation is occurring about 400–450 light years distant in the ρ
                        Ophiuchi cloud complex. </p>

                    <p class="start-text">A supernova remnant (SNR) is the structure resulting from the explosion of a
                        star in a supernova. The supernova remnant is bounded by an expanding shock wave, and consists
                        of ejected material expanding from the explosion, and the interstellar material it sweeps up and
                        shocks along the way.

                        There are two common routes to a supernova: either a massive star may run out of fuel, ceasing
                        to generate fusion energy in its core, and collapsing inward under the force of its own gravity
                        to form a neutron star or a black hole; or a white dwarf star may accrete material from a
                        companion star until it reaches a critical mass and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion.
